            <h2>A Little Extra...</h2>
            <p>Thank you for all the great time we spent together, in front of a screen, working or sending memes.
            This year I wanted to make your birthday gift a bit special. So, instead of just spending some money
            I wanted to gift you something more, my time. I've been working on creating, designing, and writing all this.
            I tried to emulate the aurora lights on the celestial night sky, something I think would suit you. 
            I also bought and setup this domain (arshiarauf.me) for you, its your's now. Feel free to use it for whatever 
            purpose you may wish and make it even more special (like a portfolio website). This piece of art now exists on 
            the internet. Whilst hope is a sad thing, I’ll always have faith because faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens.
            Even though you might ignore me, and one day I just might not be there, but what I do hope is that this exists 
            until the end of time as a proof to what we went through and achieved together. There is a small margin between courage and stupidity.
            Sometimes courage is knowing there could be trouble, but taking the chance anyway, and that is called inner strength.
            Everyone is fighting their own battles and I wish you all the best for yours!</p>
