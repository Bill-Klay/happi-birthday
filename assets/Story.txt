Well, I couldn't send a gift to your office.
And asking for your home address would have been really awkward.
So I thought I'd gift you some of my time instead of a monetary one.
I made this website to wish you!
Sooo, basically back in November I had planned to not just make a shitty website, but do a portfolio design for you.
I thought I'd start a month earlier and be done with it a week before.
But honestly I did see this happening, and I couldn't do much about it.
I had been really really busy these couple of months and haven't had much time for myself, let alone this portfolio design.
So, I just started to design this website earlier today and thought I'd be done right before 12AM.
If I get late then I really apologize, I promised I'd be done with it before 29th.
Then buy a domain for you and host it there.
And ofcourse the domain could be your monetary gift :P
Yes, this domain is yours to keep, use it however you please.
You can have the password and credentials from me later though, I couldn't paste them here :(
At first I thought I'd make a SPA with Vuetify3 and host it on my AWS EC2 instance with Route53 for the sake of privacy.
But then buying a domain would have been useless because I would have to use a proxy to host it for which I didn't have much time.
I'm sorry if this seems awkward or cringes you out, but trust me I do this with good intent and for the humour of course :D
I hope you like it, and if not atleast it brought a smile to your face. 
(I know you're probably smiling right now, but if not then this was really stupid)

HAPPY BIRTHDAY SARAH!!!
